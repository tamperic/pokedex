# Pokedex

___

## Project description

Pokedex is a project that is part of my learning journey of Full-Stack Web Development in the CareerFoundry course. This project was made using JavaScript, HTML and CSS languages.

It's a web app that allows users to find a list of Pokémons, and also to view more details of a particular Pokémon by clicking on that Pokémon.

## How it works

On the homepage is a list of Pokémon buttons, the user needs to click on a specific one and there will be displayed a modal container that contains more details about selected Pokémon, such as:
- name
- height
- weight
- type(s).

By clicking outside of the modal container, on 'X' or 'Close' button, the user will be returned to the homepage.

## PokéAPI

It was used the _PokéAPI_ (https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch data of each Pokémon.
